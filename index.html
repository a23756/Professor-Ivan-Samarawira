        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p class="autobio"><justify>
        This book was written for publication in America, and its
        copyright No. TXU-875-609 was registered in the Copyright
        Office, Library of Congress, USA in 1998.
        Its publication was unduly delayed for several reasons.
        The main reasons at that time were the prevailing religious and
        bioethical considerations. Additionally, the ban on human cloning
        prompted the postponement of its publication. Furthermore, my
        Literary Agent-The Seymour Agency, N.Y. USA did not pursue
        its publication following my return to Sri Lanka.
        Now that the ban on stem cell research has been lifted and
        the basic techniques presented in this book for Nuclear Somatic
        Transfer (NST) or cloning, have not changed the publication of
        this book now appears to be timely.
        The sequencing of the genetic code of the 23 pairs of
        chromosomes comprising the human genome has been completed
        by Celera Genomics, Inc. Maryland, USA, and the National
        Human /genome Research Institute, USA. The clock has turned
        the full circle and cannot be turned back.
        The advantages of cloning far outweigh any disadvantages
        based on ethical, religious or other considerations. This book
        gives a concise account of such advantages to human medicine.
        In Vitro Fertilization’ (IVF) fertilization of an egg with sperm 
        in a Petri dish outside the womb of the mother was discovered in
        1978 with the birth of the frst IVF baby, Louise Brown.
        However, religious and bioethical considerations prevented
        the popularization of the technique for several years. IVF is
        now accepted as an alternative reproduction technique. Dr.
        Robert Edwards who discovered IVF in 1978 was awarded the
        Nobel Prize in Medicine only in 2010, ie 22 years after IVF
        was discovered although the basic 1978 techniques remains
        unchanged in 2010, and thousands of children the world over
        have been created through IVF. In Sri Lanka, a 42 percent success
        rate has been reported with the birth of 150 children through IVF.
        The basic techniques used in Embryo Reconstruction
        or cloning discovered by Professor Ian Wilmut in 1997, and
        described in this book haven’t changed. Nuclear Somatic Transfer
        (NST) or the Cloning Method offers promise to infertile couples
        who might not like Artifcial Insemination Donor (AID) or even
        invitro-fertilization.
        This book overviews latest Technologies of Advanced
        Research by leading World Renowned Scientists who have
        attempted to demonstrate the enormous powers now available to
        man to design Life at will. Einstein is reported to have said that
        “God does not play dice with the Universe.’’
        It would seem that God has now empowered man with
        Advanced Technologies to even direct the future evolution of
        man.
